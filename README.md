### Inheritance

## Exercise 00:
### Aaaaand... OPEN!
First, you have to implement a class! How original!
It will be called ClapTrap

## Exercise 01:
### Serena, my love!
Because you can never have enough ClapTraps, you will now create a derived robot.
It will be named ScavTrap and will inherit the constructors and destructor from ClapTrap. However, its constructors, destructor and attack() will print different messages.
After all, ClapTraps are aware of their individuality.

## Exercise 02:
### Repetitive work
Now, implement a FragTrap class that inherits from ClapTrap

## Exercise 03:
### Now it’s weird!
In this exercise, you will create a monster: a ClapTrap that’s half FragTrap, half
ScavTrap. It will be named DiamondTrap, and it will inherit from both the FragTrap
AND the ScavTrap. This is so risky!
